    "### Hexbin map\n",
    "\n",
    "Hexagons are increasingly favored in the visualization of large geospatial datasets for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficient Coverage and Less Wastage:** Hexagons cover a surface area more efficiently than squares or triangles. When visualizing large areas, hexagonal tiling reduces gaps and overlaps, ensuring more uniform data representation. \n",
    "2. **Uniformity of Data Representation:** Each hexagon has six sides of equal length, which results in a more uniform distance between the center of each hexagon and any point on its boundary. This uniformity ensures that each data point within a hexagon is equally representative of its center. In contrast, square grids have varying distances from the center to the middle of the edges versus the corners, potentially introducing bias in how data is represented spatially.\n",
    "3. **Better Nearest Neighbor Analysis:** Hexagons have a unique advantage due to their six equidistant neighbors, which is beneficial for nearest neighbor analysis. This property ensures that each cell interacts more symmetrically with its surroundings, providing a more natural flow of data and smoother transitions across the grid. Squares, on the other hand, connect to their neighbors at four sides and interact less directly with their diagonal neighbors, which can complicate analyses involving spatial relationships.\n",
    "4. **Visual Appeal and Reduced Visual Errors:** Hexagonal grids tend to be more visually appealing and easier for the human eye to follow. This can enhance the overall readability and interpretation of maps. Furthermore, the equidistant properties of hexagons can reduce visual distortions that often occur with square grids, where the clustering of data points might appear more intense at the corners compared to the center.\n",
    "5. **Efficient Computation:** Despite a seemingly complex shape, algorithms for processing hexagonal grids are often more straightforward and computationally efficient for spatial data analyses than those for squares. This is due to the consistent distances and connectivity, which simplify the computation of spatial relationships and aggregations.\n"
