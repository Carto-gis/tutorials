    "# Global static map with Cartopy\n",
    "In this tutorial we will create a global map showing the connections between major airports around the world. Among other libraries we use in this tutorial, we will work with Cartopy to visualize our geospatial data. [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) is a Python library designed for cartography and geographic data processing. It's built on top of Matplotlib and provides a powerful interface for creating maps and visualizing geospatial data. With Cartopy, you can easily manipulate and project geographic datasets onto different map projections, draw maps for different regions of the world, and overlay data points, lines, and polygons. Whether you're working on complex geospatial analysis, creating detailed maps for a presentation, or just exploring the world's geography, Cartopy offers good tools to bring your geographic data to life.

    "### Creating line objects to represent flight routes\n",
    "Now that we did some data preparation, we use Shapely library to visualize flight routes between airports on a map. You ca refresh your memory of Shapely library from [AutoGIS course page](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/lesson-1/geometry-objects.html) Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what each part of the code is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import LineString from Shapely**: `LineString` is a geometric object consisting of multiple points to form a line. We import it to represent the flight routes geometrically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create LineString Objects for Each Route**:\n",
    "    - We iterate over each row in the `routes` DataFrame, which contains information about each flight route, including the source and destination airports' coordinates (`long_source`, `lat_source`, `long_destination`, `lat_destination`).\n",
    "    - For every route, we create a `LineString` object that connects the source airport to the destination airport using their longitude and latitude coordinates. This effectively draws a line between the two points on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a GeoDataFrame for Routes**:\n",
    "    - With the list of `LineString` objects (each representing a flight route), we create a new GeoDataFrame called `routes_geodata`. This GeoDataFrame contains all the original route information, plus a new `geometry` column where each entry is a `LineString` object corresponding to that route.\n",
    "    - We also specify the coordinate reference system (CRS), which is 'EPSG:4326'. This CRS corresponds to the widely used WGS 84 latitude-longitude coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By transforming our route data into a GeoDataFrame with line geometries, we can easily visualize these flight paths on a map, providing a clear and informative visual representation of air travel connections.\n"

    "    <h4>Why Use Different Projections for Routes and Airports?</h4>\n",
    "    <p>Using two different projections for routes (<code>ccrs.Geodetic()</code>) and airports (<code>ccrs.PlateCarree()</code>) in the code primarily relates to the way Cartopy handles the transformation of data when plotting on a map projection, such as <code>ccrs.Robinson()</code>.</p>\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Routes (Lines) with <code>ccrs.Geodetic()</code>:</strong>\n",
    "            <ul>\n",
    "                <li>When plotting lines that span significant portions of the globe (like flight routes), using the <code>ccrs.Geodetic()</code> transform ensures that the lines are correctly drawn as the shortest paths between two points on the globe's surface, taking into account the Earth's curvature. This is especially important for long-distance routes, which might not appear as straight lines on certain map projections due to the spherical nature of the Earth.</li>\n",
    "                <li>The <code>ccrs.Geodetic()</code> transform tells Cartopy to interpret the line endpoints in geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and to plot the \"great circle\" path between them, which represents the shortest distance between those points on the Earth's surface.</li>\n",
    "            </ul>\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Airports (Points) with <code>ccrs.PlateCarree()</code>:</strong>\n",
    "            <ul>\n",
    "                <li>The <code>ccrs.PlateCarree()</code> projection is essentially a simple map projection where the latitude and longitude are directly mapped to a grid. This makes it straightforward for plotting point data that is already given in latitude and longitude, as is typically the case with airport locations.</li>\n",
    "                <li>Using <code>ccrs.PlateCarree()</code> for points does not have the same implications as for lines, since points are just single locations on the map. The transformation is used to ensure that these points are accurately placed according to their latitude and longitude on the projected map.</li>\n",
    "            </ul>\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "    <p>In essence, the choice of <code>ccrs.Geodetic()</code> for routes and <code>ccrs.PlateCarree()</code> for airports optimizes the accuracy and visual correctness of the plotted data. It ensures that routes are drawn as realistically as possible, accounting for the Earth's curvature, while airports are accurately positioned according to their geographic coordinates. This approach leverages the strengths of different transformations for the specific types of geospatial data being visualized.</p>\n",
